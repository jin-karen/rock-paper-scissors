# Rock Paper Scissors Game
An implementation of classic childrenâ€™s game with a fun twist, created in conjunction to following The Odin Project Curriculum. As a camper, the goal of the game is to beat the bear in five rounds of rock, paper, scissors to win a pile of cooked fish. This game can currently only be played by one player at a time against the computer.

This game is recreated with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. It is my first project application of Javascript and showcases fundamental concepts such as DOM manipulation, setTimeout, event listeners, animations, callback functions, etc. The project also enabled practice of HTML/CSS comprehension and deepened knowledge on HTML audio elements, CSS formatting, animation and keyframes, transforms, and media queries.
